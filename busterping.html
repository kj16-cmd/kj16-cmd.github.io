        <h2>About Buster Ping</h2>
        <p>Hey, I’m <strong>Buster Ping</strong>—the only name you need to know. Welcome to my personal space on the web. If you're here, you're either curious or lost. Either way, I’ve got stories to tell and a few secrets to share.</p>

        <h2>Pet</h2>
        <p>Meet my dog, <strong>Horatio</strong>—he’s a true legend. He's got my back when things get rough, and no one can question his loyalty. While I do most of the heavy lifting around here, Horatio is definitely the brains of the operation. Don't let his cute face fool you.</p>

    <section id="movie">
        <h2>Favourite Movie</h2>
        <p>My favourite movie? "La La Land". It's a masterpiece of dreams and ambition. Reminds me of my hustle—always aiming higher, breaking limits, and dancing to my own rhythm. You won’t get it unless you're in my shoes.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hacking:</strong> I’m a master at cracking systems and breaking barriers. I don’t just hack—I dominate.</li>
            <li><strong>Thieving:</strong> Call it what you want, but I know how to get my hands on things that others can’t. It’s a rush, honestly.</li>
            <li><strong>Parkour:</strong> You’ve got to be quick on your feet when the heat’s on. I’ve got more moves than a street dancer.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Games:</strong> I’m a strategist at heart. Nothing beats the thrill of a well-executed game plan, whether it’s in the digital world or the real one.</li>

        <h2>Bragging Rights</h2>
        <p>Look, I don’t mean to boast, but I’m damn good at what I do. I’ve broken into systems no one thought were possible to crack, pulled off heists that’ll make your head spin, and made a lot of money along the way.</p>
        <p>But here’s the thing—money isn’t the goal. It’s about the thrill. The challenge. You wouldn’t understand unless you’ve lived it.</p>
        <p>Whether my name is really Buster Ping or something else, doesn’t really matter. What matters is that you won’t forget me once you’ve been in my world.</p>
