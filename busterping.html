        <h2>About Buster Ping</h2>
        <p>Hey there, I'm <strong>Buster Ping</strong>—the name’s a bit of a mystery, but that’s kind of the point. This site is just a small glimpse into my world, and if you're here, well, you've probably got a good reason. I'm not one for long introductions, so I’ll keep it simple: I do things my way, and I've found that works pretty well for me.</p>

        <h2>Pet</h2>
        <p>Let me introduce you to Horatio, my dog. He’s the quiet one around here, but don’t be fooled—he’s got his own way of getting things done. We’ve been through a lot together, and honestly, he’s probably the only one who knows all the details I don’t want to share with anyone else.</p>

        <h2>Favourite Movie</h2>
        <p>My favourite movie? "La La Land". Some might say it's an odd choice, but I’ve always admired how the movie balances dreams and reality. It’s a little like life, don’t you think? You chase what you want, even when it seems like a bit of a gamble.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hacking:</strong> I guess you could say I’m good at it. It’s not just about breaking into systems; it's about understanding them, finding weaknesses, and improving them where possible. It's more of an art than people give it credit for.</li>
            <li><strong>Thieving:</strong> Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it theft. I just... have a knack for finding things that others can't seem to get their hands on. There's a fine line between taking and borrowing, don’t you think?</li>
            <li><strong>Parkour:</strong> I like to keep in shape. Being quick and agile can be useful, especially if you need to make a fast exit. It’s a fun challenge, too.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Games:</strong> When I’m not working, I play a lot of strategy games. It’s a way to unwind, but also to keep the mind sharp. It’s all about thinking ahead, anticipating moves, and staying two steps ahead of everyone else.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Bragging Rights (But Not Really)</h2>
        <p>Okay, maybe I’ll admit it: I’ve done a few things people might find impressive. I’ve cracked some tough systems, and I’ve had a couple of... let's call them "successful ventures." But really, it’s all just part of the game. It’s not about the big wins, it’s about the little moments of satisfaction when everything goes according to plan.</p>
        <p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m proud of what I do. But I’m not one to go on about it too much. The work speaks for itself.</p>
